\f0\fs24 \cf0 I knew before taking the quiz that I tended to be a visual learner, but I didn\'92t realize how closely tactile learning came in second (45% vs 50%).  It was also shocking to me to read about learning styles not having significant impact on actual learning in a classroom setting.  I definitely believe that some people absorb information better than others in certain settings, so it was interesting to know that the biggest impact that the learning styles can have on learning is through studying with those learning styles.  Since auditory was only 5% for me, it seems like my learning style will match the way that most courses are structured.}
